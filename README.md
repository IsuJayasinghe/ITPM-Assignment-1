## 📌 Project Synopsis
This project includes automated functional and user interface test cases created with **Playwright** to assess the precision, resilience, and 
usefulness of the **Singlish to Sinhala transliteration system** accessible at:
https://www.swifttranslator.com/
## Objectives
- Validate the accuracy of Singlish to Sinhala conversion
- Identify incorrect or unstable transliteration behavior
- Evaluate UI behavior such as real-time output updates
- Automate all identified test scenarios using Playwright
## Test Coverage
The automated test suite includes:

- ✅ Positive Functional Test Cases (accuracy validation)
- ❌ Negative Functional Test Cases (robustness validation)
- 🖥️ UI Test Cases (real-time updates, input handling)

Test scenarios cover:
- Simple, compound, and complex sentences
- Interrogative and imperative forms
- Positive and negative sentence structures
- Tense variations (past, present, future)
- Mixed Singlish + English inputs
- Numbers, currency, dates, and time formats
- Slang, spacing issues, and formatting variations
- UI behaviors such as live output updates and input clearing
